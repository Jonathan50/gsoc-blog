        <h2>Basic differences (ath vs athn)</h2>

          ath(4) and athn(4) support somewhat different sets of hardware.  The
          most obvious difference in implementation is that ath(4) uses the
          Atheros HAL.  This was initially a blob but
          <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Njc1MA">
            open-sourced in 2009</a>.
          According to the
          <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/dev/ath_hal%284%29">
            FreeBSD wiki</a>,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The Atheros HAL is an abstraction layer which attempts to hide much of the card specific configuration from the rest of the atheros wireless driver.</p>
          <p>The HAL takes care of the MAC, baseband and radio. It exports a set of routines which allow the atheros wireless driver to do certain tasks (set channel, configure TX queue, queue TX packet, queue RX buffer, setup interrupts, do calibration, set/get TX power, configure beacon parameters, enter power saving/sleep mode, etc.)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It doesn't seem that it'll require any changes (except ah_osdep.c).
        </p>
        <p>
          So, for example, athn.c has routines that directly change particular
          registers (using <code>AR_WRITE</code> i.e. <code>sc_ops.write</code>
          which might resolve to <code>athn_pci_write</code>), the lowest-level
          routines being implemented in if_athn_pci.c & if_athn_cardbus.c,
          whereas ath.c uses the higher-level routines already provided by the HAL.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>ath_softc</code> and <code>athn_softc</code> are the most
          important structs in both, which, presumably, will have a few mutexes
          on them when finished (as FreeBSD).  ath(4) seems to be the more
          complicated of the two drivers.

          NetBSD is undergoing a
          <a href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/Wifi_renewal_on_hg">
            transition to a new Wi-Fi stack</a>.
          My project is to convert the drivers athn(4) and if time allows ath(4).
        </p>
        <p>
          This far I have ensured that the wifi branch builds and runs on the
          target netbook.  All the unconverted drivers need to be disabled.
          Ethernet works.  Presently it identifies as NetBSD 9.99.100.
        </p>
        <p>
          To examine:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            dev/pci/if_athn_pci.c and dev/pci/if_ath_pci.c and (perhaps
            especially) dev/ic/athn.c and dev/ic/ath.c
          </li>
          <li>other converted drivers e.g. rtwn(4)</li>
          <li>
            FreeBSD
            <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/tree/sys/dev/ath?h=main">ath(4)</a>
            &ndash; converted and seemingly a lot more code now</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          One of the most obvious differences in the converted drivers is
          the locking (<code>mutex_init</code>, <code>mutex_enter</code>,
          <code>mutex_exit</code>).
